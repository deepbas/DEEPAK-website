# Association and Causation


.bql[Two variables are .b[associated] if values of one variable tends to
be related to values of the other variable
- e.g. .green-h[Families with many cars tend to own many television sets]

&lt;br&gt;

.bql[Two variables are .b[causally associated] if changing the value of
the explanatory variable influences the value of the response

# College Education and Aging

.bql[
.font80[
“Education seems to be an elixir that can bring us a healthy body and mind
throughout adulthood and even a longer life,” says Margie E. Lachman, a psychologist
at Brandeis University who specializes in aging. “For those in midlife and beyond, a
college degree appears to slow the brain’s aging process by up to a decade, adding a
new twist to the cost-benefit analysis of higher education - for young students as
well as those thinking about returning to school.”]]



Which of the following is true?

.bql.font80[
1. Explanatory Variable = brain aging; Response Variable = elixir
2. Explanatory Variable = brain aging; Response Variable = college
degree
3. Explanatory Variable = college degree; Response Variable = brain
aging
]

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary class="answer"&gt;Click for answer&lt;/summary&gt;
The correct answer is 3.
&lt;/details&gt;

No. There could be other factors, such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle choices, or genetic predispositions, that contribute to both higher education attainment and slower brain aging

# Experiment or Observational Study?

.bq[
To examine whether farm-grown salmon contain more omega-3 oils
if water is more acidic, we collect samples of salmon and water from
multiple fish farms to see if the two variables are related.

- Experiment
- Observational Study
]

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary class="answer"&gt;Click for answer&lt;/summary&gt;
This is an observational study because the researchers do not actively manipulate or control the acidity of the water; they simply observe the naturally occurring conditions at each fish farm.

# Randomized Experiments

.bql.font90[
- In a .b[randomized experiment], the explanatory variable for each
unit is determined randomly, before the response variable is
measured

- The different levels of the explanatory variable are known as
.b[treatments]

  - Randomly divide the units into groups, and randomly assign a
different treatment to each group
  - Observe the response variable after treatments are applied

# Knee Surgery, Control Groups

.bql[### Study Context

- Researchers investigated the effectiveness of knee surgery for arthritis.
- Patients who underwent surgery reported less pain.

.bql[### The Importance of a Control Group

- To validate if the surgery was effective, a control group received a fake knee surgery.
- Results were indistinguishable between the control and treatment groups.

# Control Group

.bq[
### Placebo Effect
- Control groups often get a placebo to measure the effect.
- It is estimated that 75% of the effectiveness of anti-depressant medication is due to the placebo effect.

# Randomized Experiments Types: `randomized comparative experiment`

.bql[
- Individuals are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. 
- Most effective when the investigator has no prior knowledge of the individuals who are part of the experiment.

# Randomized Experiments Types: `matched pairs experiment`


.bql[
- Each individual in the experimental group is matched with an individual in the control group based on a specific criterion. 
- Most effective when the investigator has prior knowledge of the individuals involved in the experiment.
]

.blue-h[Example: A researcher matches participants based on age, gender, and education level, then assigns one participant in the matched pair to the drug treatment group and the other to the control group to measure the effectiveness of the drug.]

# Variations of matched pairs experiments: `Training program effectiveness`

.pull-left[## Before-After Test: 
.bq.font80[
- Measure everyone's skill level before any training.

  - .b[Example:] Time each runner's 100m sprint.
  
- Train only one group.

- Measure again and compare.

  - .b[Example:] Time the 100m sprint again and see who improved more.
]
]
.pull-right[## Two-Times Test: 
.bq.font80[
- Everyone gets both training and no training, but in random order.

  - .b[Example:] Flip a coin to decide who gets training first.
  
- Measure skill after each.

  - .b[Example:] Time each 100m sprint after both.
  
- Compare the same person's times to see which training worked.

&lt;!--
In the provided example, the "matching" comes from using the same individual to represent both the "before" and "after" states in the experiments. In paired designs, each subject essentially serves as their own control, which is a form of matching.

Before-After Test: The matching here is temporal; the same individual's sprint time is measured before and after the training. By comparing these two measurements for each individual, the paired design accounts for many of the other variables that might affect sprint time, since each person serves as their own baseline or control.

Two-Times Test (Repeated Measures): In this design, each individual undergoes both conditions (training and no training). The matching here is again based on the individual: the same person's performance under both conditions is compared. By doing so, the design controls for subject-specific variables.

In both designs, the pairing or matching occurs at the level of the individual subject, reducing the impact of between-subject variability and thereby often providing a more precise estimate of the treatment effect.


In summary, the choice between the two designs depends on the complexity of the research question, the limitations in resources, and the specific confounding variables that the experiment aims to control for.
