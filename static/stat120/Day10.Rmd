# Statistical Significance

.blockquote[
When results as extreme as the observed sample statistic are unlikely to occur by .bold[random chance] alone (assuming the null hypothesis is true), we say the sample results are .bold[statistically significant]
- If our sample is .bold[statistically significant], we have convincing .bold[evidence against] $\mathrm{H}_{0}$, .bold[in favor of] $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{a}}$
- If our sample is .bold[not statistically significant], our test is .bold[inconclusive]. The null hypothesis may be true (or maybe not).

]

<br>
.blockquote[
If results are statistically significant ...
- the sample proportion of correct guesses is higher than is likely just by random chance (if ESP does not exist and $\mathrm{p}=1 / 5$ )
- we have evidence that the true proportion of correct guesses really is higher than $1 / 5$, and thus have evidence of ESP

# Summary

.blockquote[
- Statistical tests use data from a sample to assess a claim about a population
- Statistical tests are usually formalized with competing hypotheses:
- Null hypothesis $\left(\mathrm{H}_{0}\right)$ : no effect or no difference
- Alternative hypothesis $\left(\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ : what we seek evidence for
- If data are statistically significant, we have convincing evidence against the null hypothesis, and in favor of the alternative
