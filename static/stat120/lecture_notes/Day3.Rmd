# Explanatory and Response

.blockquote[
If we are using one variable to help us understand or predict values
of another variable, we call the former the .bold[explanatory variable] and
the latter the .bold[response variable]
]



---

# Association and Causation


.blockquote[Two variables are .bold[associated] if values of one variable tends to
be related to values of the other variable
- e.g. .yellow-h[Families with many cars tend to own many television sets]
]

<br>

.blockquote[Two variables are .bold[causally associated] if changing the value of
the explanatory variable influences the value of the response
variable

# College Education and Aging

.blockquote[
.font80[
“Education seems to be an elixir that can bring us a healthy body and mind
throughout adulthood and even a longer life,” says Margie E. Lachman, a psychologist
at Brandeis University who specializes in aging. “For those in midlife and beyond, a
college degree appears to slow the brain’s aging process by up to a decade, adding a
new twist to the cost-benefit analysis of higher education - for young students as
well as those thinking about returning to school.”]]

Which of the following is true?

.blockquote-list[
1. Explanatory Variable = brain aging; Response Variable = elixir
2. Explanatory Variable = brain aging; Response Variable = college
degree
3. Explanatory Variable = college degree; Response Variable = brain
aging

# Confounding Variable

.font120[
> A third variable that is associated with both the explanatory
variable and the response variable is called a .bold[confounding variable]

# Experiment Vs Observational Study

.font120.blockquote[
An .out-t.bold[observational study] is a study in which the researcher does
not actively control the value of any variable, but simply
observes the values as they naturally exist

# Experiment or Observational Study?

.blockquote[
To examine whether playing music in a store increases the amount
customers spend, we randomly assign some stores to play music and
some to stay silent and compare the average amount spent by
customers. Does this describe an experiment or an observational
study?

- Experiment
- Observational Study

# Experiment or Observational Study?

.blockquote[
To examine whether farm-grown salmon contain more omega-3 oils
if water is more acidic, we collect samples of salmon and water from
multiple fish farms to see if the two variables are related.

# Observational Studies and Confounding Variable

.blockquote-list[
- There are almost always confounding variables in observational
studies

- Observational studies can almost never be used to establish
causation!!

# Randomized Experiments

.blockquote-list[
- In a .bold[randomized experiment], the explanatory variable for each
unit is determined randomly, before the response variable is
measured
- The different levels of the explanatory variable are known as
.bold[treatments]
- Randomly divide the units into groups, and randomly assign a
different treatment to each group
- Observe the response variable after treatments are applied

# Exercise and the Brain

.blockquote-list[
- A sample of mice were divided randomly into two groups. One
group was given access to an exercise wheel, the other group
was kept sedentary
- "The brains of mice and rats that were allowed to run on wheels
pulsed with vigorous, newly born neurons, and those animals
then breezed through mazes and other tests of rodent IQ"
compared to the sedentary mice
]

Is this evidence that exercise causes an increase in brain
activity and IQ, at least in mice?

# Knee Surgery and Arthritis

> Researchers conducted a study on the effectiveness of a knee
surgery to cure arthritis. It was randomly determined whether
people got the knee surgery. Everyone who underwent the
surgery reported feeling less pain

--

- Is this evidence that the surgery causes a decrease in pain?

class: middle

# Control Group

.blockquote-list[
- When determining whether a treatment is effective, it is
important to have a comparison group, known as the .bold[control group]

- All randomized experiments need either a control group, or at
least two different treatments to compare
]

---


# Knee Surgery for Arthritis

.blockquote-list[
- In the knee surgery study, those in the control group received a
.bold[fake knee surgery]. They were put under and cut open, but the
doctor did not actually perform the surgery. All of these patients
also reported less pain!

- The improvement was .bold[indistinguishable] between those receiving
the real surgery and those receiving the fake surgery!

# Placebo Effect


.blockquote-list[
- People can experience the effect they think they should be
experiencing, even if they aren’t actually receiving the treatment

- One study estimated that 75% of the effectiveness of
anti-depressant medication is due to the .bold[placebo effect]

# Placebo and Blinding

.blockquote-list[
- Control groups are often given a .bold[placebo], a fake treatment that resembles the active treatment as much as possible
- If possible, randomized experiments should be .bold[double-blinded:] neither the participants or the researchers evaluating participants should know which treatment the participants are actually getting
]

# Types of Randomized Experiments

.blockquote-list[
- Randomizing cases into different treatment groups is called a
.bold[randomized comparative experiment]
- We can also give each treatment to each case, and just
randomize the order in which treatments are received: .bold[matched pairs experiment]
- There are other, more complicated types of randomized
experiments (blocking, split plots, …)

# More on Randomization

.blockquote-list[
- Doing a randomized experiment on a random sample is ideal,
but rarely achievable. (why?)
- If the focus of the study is using a sample to estimate a
population parameter, you need a random sample but do not
need a randomized experiment (example: election polling)
- If the focus of the study is establishing causality, you need a
randomized experiment and can settle for a non-random
sample (example: drug testing)
