Statistics is distinct from mathematics

Study of data and the uncertainties surrounding them

We will take a more conceptual route to statistics in this course

# Software Component

.blockquote[
- Statistical computing software called R
- RStudio gives nice user-friendly interface to R
- RMarkdown is platform in Rstudio to write your codes and results

# What and Why of Statistics.

.blockquote-list[
- Science of collecting, describing, and analyzing data
  + Sampling
  + Exploratory Data Analysis
  + Inference

- Makes it easier to know the source of uncertainties

- Let's us take an unbiased viewpoint

# Data: Cases and Variables

.blockquote-list[
Data are a set of measurements taken on a set of individual units
- These are .bold[cases] or units

Data is stored and presented in a dataset that comprises of variables measured on cases
- A .bold[variable] is any characteristic that is recorded for each case

# Categorical Versus Quantitative

> Variables are classified as either categorical or quantitative:

<br>

- A categorical variable divides the cases into groups. e.g. gender,
country, state etc.

- A quantitative variable measures a numerical quantity for each
case, e.g. age, height, sleep hours, blood pressure etc

# Kidney cancer

> Counties with the highest kidney cancer rates

# Kidney cancer

> If the cases in the kidney cancer dataset are people, then the measured variable is .bold[categorical]

--

- We categorize each person as either having kidney
cancer or not which is categorical.

---

# Kidney cancer

> If the cases in the kidney cancer dataset are counties, then the measured variable is .bold[quantitative]

- Data collected at the county level is aggregated
across all people living in the county. We then get
rates of cancer which are numbers (quantitative).

---

# Variable manipulations

.blockquote[
Can use numbers to code categories of categorical variable
- e.g Gender (1 for male and 2 for female)
]

--

.blockquote[
Can convert quantitative variable into categorical groups
- e.g. Income (0-50000 as Low, 50000+ as High)
]

--

.blockquote[
Categorical variables are sometimes collapsed into fewer levels
- e.g. no HS degree, HS degree, some college, 2 year degree
]

# Explanatory and Response Variable

> When one variable helps us understand or predict values of another variable, we call the former the .bold[explanatory variable] and the latter the .bold[response variable]

.pull-left[

.blockquote[
Does meditation help reduce stress?
- explanatory variable: .bold[meditation]
- response variable: .bold[stress level]
]
]

.pull-right[
.blockquote[
Does sugar consumption increase hyperactivity?
- explanatory variable: .bold[sugar consumption]
- response variable: .bold[hyperactive behavior]
