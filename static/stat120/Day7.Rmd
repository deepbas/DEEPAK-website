# Sampling Distribution


.pull-left[


.bql[A .bold[sampling distribution] is the distribution of sample statistics computed for different samples of the same size from the same population.
- Sample statistics varies from sample to sample
- Sampling distribution gives us an idea of the variation

# Center and Shape

.bql[
.bold[Center:] If samples are randomly selected, the sampling distribution will be centered around the population parameter.

.bold[Shape:] For most of the statistics we consider, if the sample size is large enough the sampling distribution will be symmetric and bell-shaped.
]

class: middle

# Standard Error



.bql.font90[
Uncertainty in point estimates measured by the .bold[standard error (SE)]
- The .bold[standard error] of a statistic is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
- The .bold[standard error] measures how much the statistic varies from sample to sample

- As the sample size increases, the variability (SE) of the sample statistics tends to decrease.
- Smaller SE means the sample statistics tend to be closer to the true population parameter value!

.bq[
- .bold[Quantitative variable:] the larger the population standard deviation, the larger the standard error of a statistic (like a mean)

- .bold[Categorical variable:] the closer the population proportion is to 0.5, the larger the standard error of the sample proportion

# Sample Size vs. Simulation size

.red.bold[Do not confuse sample size and simulation size !!]

.pull-left[
.bql[
.bold.blue[Sample size (n)] = how many individuals are in the sample used to compute our stat?

.pull-right[

.bql[
.bold.blue[Simulation size (N)] = how many random samples did we take from the population to simulate the sampling distribution of our stat?


]

]

.bqt.font90[
- The SE of your stat gets smaller as $n$ get bigger.
- Once you’ve simulated a couple $100$ samples, the shape/center/spread of the sampling distribution should remain about the same as you increase the simulation size.
