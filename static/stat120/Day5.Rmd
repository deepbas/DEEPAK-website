# Distribution 

.bql[

.green-h["The distribution of the variable Y"]

- describes its center, variability and shape
- use both numbers and graphics

]




---

# Center: Mean or Average

.bq[
Mean: average value in a sample or population

- $\overline{y} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}$ is an average of $n$ values $y_i$ in a sample
- $\mu$ is an average value of $y$ in a population
]


Example: The data `StudentSurvey.csv` is a sample of student survey responses obtained by the textbook authors


```{r}
survey <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/StudentSurvey.csv")
mean(survey$Pulse) # the command `mean` computes an average
```

The mean pulse rate for this sample of students is $\overline{y} = 69.6$ beats per minute.

---

# Center: Median
.bq[
.bold[Median:] the middle value when the data are ordered
- The median splits the data in half
- $m$ is the median value in a sample
- $M$ is the median value in a population
]

```{r}
median(survey$Pulse) # the command `median` computes an median
```

.bq.font90[
The median pulse rate for this sample of students is $m = 70$ beats per minute. 
- This means half the students have a rate below 70 and half have a rate about 70.
]

---

# Variability: Standard Deviation

.bq[
Standard Devation (SD): average value in a sample or population
- $s = \sqrt{ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \overline{y})^2}{n-1}}$ is the SD of $n$ values $y_i$ in a sample
- $\sigma$ is the SD of values of $y$ in a population
]

```{r}
sd(survey$Pulse) # the command `sd` computes an average
```

.bq.font90[
The SD of pulse rates for this sample of students is $s = 12.2$ beats per minute.
- The "average" deviation of individual pulse rates around the mean value is about 12.2 beats per minute.

# Missing Data in R

.bql[
- Missing data values in R are coded as `NA` values
- Many basic statistic functions in R return an NA value if variable has any missing values
]

--

Example: `HollywoodMovies2011.csv` 

```{r}
movies <-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/HollywoodMovies2011.csv")
mean(movies$WorldGross)
sd(movies$WorldGross)
```

--

.yellow-h[This lets the user (you) know that at least one value (maybe many, many values!) are missing]

---

# Missing Data in R

- Use the `summary` command to find how many are missing

```{r}
summary(movies$WorldGross)
```

--

There are 2 movies with missing world gross amounts. 

--

.bql[Add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to remove missing values and get your summary stats:]

--

```{r}
mean(movies$WorldGross, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(movies$WorldGross, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Extreme values

.bql.font80[.bold[outlier:] an observed value that is notably distinct from most other values in the dataset

.bold[resistant:] a statistic is resistant to outliers if it is relatively unaffected by outliers

- Median is resistant to outliers
- Mean and SD are not resistant

--

- Which movies had world gross bigger than 1200?

--

```{r}

movies[4, c("Movie","WorldGross")]
```

--

Harry Potter (row number 4) had world gross of 1.328 billion dollars!

---

# Identifying extreme values in R

What are stats without Harry Potter?

--

- omit .bold[row 4] from the `WorldGross` variable with the "minus row 4" subset:

--

```{r}
WorldGross.noHP <- movies$WorldGross[-4] 
```

--

- Then compare stats

```{r}
summary(movies$WorldGross) # with Harry Potter
summary(WorldGross.noHP) # without Harry Potter
sd(movies$WorldGross, na.rm = T) # with Harry Potter
sd(WorldGross.noHP, na.rm = T) # without Harry Potter
```

---

# Adding a categorical variable: stats

.bql.font80[We can compare distributions across different levels of a categorical variable to explore whether the two variables are .bold[associated].

- Use `tapply(y,x,fun)` to apply the `fun` function to `y` for different levels of `x`
- Pulse rate stats by smoking status: Smoker have a slightly higher mean pulse rate than non-smokers (71.8 vs. 69.3).

# Standardizing data: z-score

> The z-score of a data value, x, tells us how many standard deviations the value is above or below the mean:

$$z = \dfrac{x - \text{mean}}{\text{SD}}$$

- E.g. if a value $x$ has $z=-1.5$ then the value $x$ is .bold[1.5 standard deviations below] the mean.

.bql[.bold[Question:] If we standardize all values in a bell-shaped distribution, 95% of all z-scores fall between what values?]

# Standardizing data: z-score

> Z-scores put measurements on a common scale

    - ACT: $\mu = 21, \sigma = 5$
    - SAT:  $\mu = 1500, \sigma = 325$


.bql[SAT score because it is .bold[1.85 SDs above] the mean SAT score while the ACT score is only 1.4 SD above the mean ACT score.

$$z_{ACT} = \dfrac{28-21}{5} = 1.4  \qquad  z_{SAT} = \dfrac{2100-1500}{325} = 1.85$$]

# Shape and Stats: Percentiles
.bql[
Percentiles are good summary stats to describe a .bold[skewed] distribution.
- The $P^{th}$ percentile of a distribution is the value which is greater than $P\%$ of all other values.
- The median is the $50^{th}$ percentile
]

--

# Shape and Stats: Quartiles

.bold[5-number summary] is quartiles along with min and max: $\text{min}, Q_1, \text{m}, Q_3, \text{max}$

.bq[
.bold[Interquartile Range (IQR)] is the range of the middle 50% of values:
- $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$
- the .bold[range] is just $\text{max} - \text{min}$

# Shape and Stats: Quartiles

```{r}
summary(movies$WorldGross)

.bq[The 5-number summary is
- $\text{min} = 0.025, Q_1 = 30.7, \text{m}=76.7, Q_3 = 173.7, \text{max} = 1328.1$

- right skewed:  variation is upper 25 of movies is much larger than lower 25% 
  - upper range: $\text{max} - Q_3 = 1328.1 - 173.7 = 1154.4$
  - lower range: $Q_1 - \text{min} = 30.7 - 0.025 = 30.675$

# Shape and Stats: Boxplot
.bql.font90[
.bold[Boxplot:] Visualization of 5-number summary

- Draw a numerical scale appropriate for the data
- Draw a box stretching from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$

- Identify each outlier individually by plotting with a symbol such as an asterisk or dot
