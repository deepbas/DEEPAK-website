# So far ...

We know

- A basic set of geometries

- How to map variables to aesthetics

- How to layer `geoms`

Please git clone the repository [More visualizations](https://github.com/stat220/04-more-visualizations).

- Apply `theme_light()` to the histogram
- Close "gap" between bars and axis
- Remove legend title, border and minor grid lines
- Re-position legend &amp; remove the background

# **ggplot2** maps

The `ggplot2` package contains latitude and longitude to define geographic boundaries

- some regions: `state`, `usa`, `world`, `county`
- see `?map_data` or `?maps` for more regions (may need to install `maps`)


```r
states &lt;- map_data("state")
glimpse(states)
Rows: 15,537
Columns: 6
$ long      &lt;dbl&gt; -87.46201, -87.48493, -87.52503, -87.53076, -87.57087, -87.5…

# What is a map?

A set of latitude longitude points...


```r

```

# What is a map?

```

&lt;img src="Day5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

class: middle

## Necessary map data

- latitude/longitude points for all map boundaries

- which boundary group all lat/long points belong 

- the order to connect points within each group

---

# Adding state-level information

-  Add other geographic information by adding geometric layers to the plot

-  Add non-geopgraphic information by altering the fill color for each state

    + Use `geom = "polygon"` to treat states as solid shapes to add color

    + Incorporate numeric information using color shade or intensity
    
    + Incorporate categorical informaion using color hue

---




# Maps using *geom_polygon*

`geom_polygon` connects the dots between lat (`y`) and long (`x`) points in a given `group`.  It connects start and end points which allows you to `fill` a closed polygon shape


```r
ggplot(states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) + 
    geom_polygon(color="black", fill="lightblue")
```

&lt;img src="Day5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Maps using *geom_polygon*

Why is scale so important in a map?


```r
ggplot(states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) + 
    geom_polygon(color="black", fill="lightblue") + 
    coord_fixed(ratio=3)
```
