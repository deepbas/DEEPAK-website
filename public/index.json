This course will cover the computational side of data analysis, including data acquisition, management, and visualization tools. The course introduces principles of data-scientific, reproducible research and dynamic programming using the R/RStudio ecosystem.\nIf you took Stat 120, 230, or 250 at Carleton, then you are in good shape. It is essential to recap your basic R and R-markdown skills by the first week of the class. Specifically, I expect that everyone can load a data set into R, calculate basic summary statistics, and create basic exploratory data analysis. I will expose you to Git and GitHub version control in the first week of the class and prior exposure to these is not required.\nLearning Objectives  Develop research questions that can be answered by data. Import/scrape data into R and reshape it to the form necessary for analysis. Manipulate common types of data, including numeric, categorical (factors), text, date-times, geo-location variables in order to provide insight into your data and facilitate analysis. Explore data using both graphical and numeric methods to provide insight and uncover relationships/patterns. Utilize fundamental programming concepts such as iteration, conditional execution, and functions to streamline your code. Build, tune, use, and evaluate basic statistical learning models to uncover clusters and classify observations. Draw informed conclusions from your data and communicate your findings using both written and interactive platforms.

Do not share R commands/code in any way, including, but not limited to, sending commands via email, slack, text, or showing commands in a shared screen with the intention of showing a classmate your solution to a problem. You can share a screen to help troubleshoot a coding problem in R.   You can use the following resources to complete your homework:  Carleton faculty (myself, other math fac, etc) discussions with classmates (see above) or knowledgeable friends Carleton resources like stats lab assistants student solutions provided in the back of your student textbook or in the student solution manual.   You cannot use any resources other than the ones listed above to complete assignments (homework, reports, etc) for this class. (e.g. you cannot use a friend‚Äôs old assignments or reports, answers found on the internet, textbook (instructor) solutions manual, etc.)  Examples that violate the academic integrity policy  sending your .Rmd homework file to another person in the class receiving an .Rmd homework file from another person sharing a screen and copying code, verbatim, from another person sending/receiving R commands neglecting to acknowledge classmates with whom you worked with on an assignment  Format and Content Submit via GitHub (for most assignments) an organized and correctly ordered assignment.\n Content: Good data scientists need to do more than just write code; they should be able to interpret and explain their analyzes.  Provide a written answer first, followed by any required R code and output. Use complete sentences when answering any problem that requires an explanation or overall problem summary.   When including code:  Be sure to show the natural sequence of work needed to answer the problem. Include brief comments explain your code steps. Do not include typos or unnecessary commands/output. Always include code output.   At the top of each individual assignment include the names of classmates that you worked with on all or part of the assignment (but each person must write up their assignment on their own)   Disability Accommodations: Carleton College is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Services office (Henry House, 107 Union Street) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, autism spectrum disorders, chronic health, traumatic brain injury and concussions, vision, hearing, mobility, or speech impairments), please contact disability@carleton.edu or call Sam Thayer (‚Äô10), Accessibility Specialist (x4464) or Chris Dallager, Director of Disability Services (x5250) to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.\nAcademic Honesty: All work that you turn in under your name must follow Carleton‚Äôs academic integrity policy. The use of textbook solution manuals (physical or online solutions), homework, reports or exams done by past students are not allowed.

If you are using RStudio on your computer, then you will need to download Git software (as directed in Software in Stat 220) to use GitHub connected projects.\nI will host all of our course materials on GitHub, and you will use GitHub to submit homework and collaborate on projects.\nGetting setup with Git and GitHub If you are not working on the maize RStudio server, then make sure that you have installed all of the software mentioned in Software in Stat 220. In addition, you should install the usethis and gitcreds R packages.\nEveryone needs to connect Git and GitHub by doing the following:\n  Register for account on GitHub (https://github.com/). I recommend using a username that incorporates your name (e.g., dbastola). Please use your Carleton email with this account.\n  If you haven‚Äôt done so already, accept the invite to the class organization DataScienceFall22. This organization is where all course homework, activity files, and project repositories will live.\n  Setup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:\nlibrary(usethis) use_git_config(user.name = \u0026quot;Jane Doe\u0026quot;, user.email = \u0026quot;jane@example.org\u0026quot;)  changing the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account).\n  In order to push changes to github (i.e. to track changes and submit homework), you will need to prove that you have permission to change a Github repo. This is done with a personal access token (PAT). Note that you will need to install the packages usethis and gitcreds to do this.\nusethis::create_github_token()  Call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to register this token in the local Git credential store It is also a great idea to store this token in any password-management software that you use ‚úì Opening URL 'https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,user,gist,workflow\u0026amp;description=R:GITHUB_PAT'  \u0026ldquo;Generate token\u0026rdquo; and store your tokens somewhere safe in your local computer as you will need this again in the future. You can additionally add PAT to your .Renviron file as well. Copy it and paste it into your .Renviron file as system variable GITHUB_PAT using\nusethis::edit_r_environ()  Add to the file and save. You can also set the PAT token in R using the following.\nlibrary(gitcreds) gitcreds::gitcreds_set()  You can check that you‚Äôve stored a credential with gitcreds_get():\ngitcreds::gitcreds_get() #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;gitcreds\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; protocol: https #\u0026gt; host : github.com #\u0026gt; username: PersonalAccessToken #\u0026gt; password: \u0026lt;-- hidden --\u0026gt;    Treat your PAT token like a password! For details, follow the step in Section 9.1 on this page to do this: https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html.\nIndividual assignments If you followed the suggestions in the Using Rstudio in Stat 220 page, then you should already have an assignments folder on your computer or maize account.\nEach new assignment/project will be posted as a repository on GitHub and added directly to your account (within the Stat220 organization). This repository will contain assignment details (README, .Rmd).\nCreating an individual assignment repo and project   Go to our course GitHub organization page (https://github.com/DataScienceFall22/) and find your homework repo, such as hw1-username (where your username is attached).\n  Enter the online assignment repository on GitHub. Click the green \u0026ldquo;Code\u0026rdquo; button. Most of you should just use the default setting which is to \u0026ldquo;clone\u0026rdquo; (copy) using HTTPS. Click the clipboard to the right of the URL to copy the repo location. (If you are using SSH, make sure it says \u0026ldquo;Clone with SSH\u0026rdquo; in bold in the top left of the pop-up box. If not, click the \u0026ldquo;SSH\u0026rdquo; button and copy the link in the box to your clipboard.)\n  Now open up RStudio and create a project as follows:\n Click the Project button in the upper right corner of your RStudio window and select New Project\u0026hellip;.    Select Version Control and then New Project      Paste the link you just copied into the Repository URL box. Leave the Project directory name blank (or keep the auto-filled name). Use the Browse button to find your assignments folder, then click Create Project       Working on your assignment An RStudio project should now open, which will allow you to start working on your homework assignment. You should see the project assignment name in the top right side of Rstudio. You will probably see a blank console screen when you open a new project. Look in the Files tab for your homework .Rmd file. Click on whatever file you want to edit (probably the .Rmd file) and edit away. Make sure that your current assignment\u0026rsquo;s project is the one open and showing in the upper rightproject name. To open a project, click on the .Rproj file or use the Open Project\u0026hellip; option available in the upper right project link.\nCommits After you make changes to the homework assignment, commit them. What are commits you ask? Commits are essentially taking a snapshot of your projects. Commits save this snapshot to your local version of Git (located on your hard drive or the maize server). For example, if I make changes to a code so that it prints \u0026ldquo;Hello world\u0026rdquo;, and then commit them with an informative message, I can look at the history of my commits and view the code that I wrote at that time. If I made some more changes to the function that resulted in an error, I could go back to the commit where the code was originally working. This prevents you from creating several versions of your homework (homework-v1, homework-v2, \u0026hellip;) or from trying to remember what your code originally looked like.\nYou can make commits in the Git tab in RStudio.\n   Click the Commit button in the Git tab. Check the boxes of the files that you want to commit, enter your commit message (briefly state what changes have been made), then hit Commit. You can read how to do this in RStudio in more detail here: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-commit.\nTwo things about committing.\n You should commit somewhat frequently. At minimum, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a homework assignment, you should make a commit each time that you\u0026rsquo;ve finished a question. Leave informative commit messages. \u0026ldquo;Added stuff\u0026rdquo; will not help you if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at your commit history in a year. A message like \u0026ldquo;Added initial version of hello-world function\u0026rdquo; will be more useful.  Pushing changes to Github At some point you\u0026rsquo;ll want to get the updated version of the assignment back onto GitHub, either so that we can help you with your code or so that it can be graded. You will also want to push work frequently when you have a shared GitHub repo for project collaborations (i.e. more than one person is working on a project and code). If you are ready to push, you can again click on the \u0026ldquo;Up\u0026rdquo; Push arrow in the Git tab or in the Commit pop-up window or in the Git tab (shown above).\nTo \u0026ldquo;turn in\u0026rdquo; an assignment, all you need to do is push all your relevant files to Github by the deadline.\nGroup work Collaborative Github assignments are pretty similar to individual assignments.\nCreating a group/partner assignment repo and project Go to our course GitHub organization page(https://github.com/DataScienceFall22/) and find the repo for your group, for example if your group name is \u0026ldquo;team01\u0026rdquo; the you might find the mp1-team01 repo. Clone this repo to your computer/maize account using the same steps done for an individual assignment (see steps 2-3).\nWorking with collaborative repos For group homework, I suggest that only the recorder edit the group-homework-x.Rmd file to avoid merge conflicts! Other group members can create a new Markdown doc to run and save commands. Only the recorder needs to push changes (answers) to the Github repo and all others can then pull these changes (i.e. the final answers) after the HW is submitted.\nWhen you are working together on a Github project, you should commit and push your modifications frequently. You will also need to frequently pull updates from Github down to your local version of RStudio. These updates are changes that your teammates have made since your last pull. To pull in changes, click the \u0026ldquo;Down\u0026rdquo; Pull arrow in the Git tab (shown above).\nIf you get an error about conflict after pulling or pushing, don\u0026rsquo;t freak out! This can happen if you edit a file (usually an .Rmd or .R file) in a location that was also changed by a teammate. When this happens you should attempt to fix the merge conflict. Take a look at this resource site and try to fix the merge conflict in Rstudio. Katie also created a diagram shown below that \u0026ldquo;explains\u0026rdquo; how and when conflicts will likely happen and how you can resolve the problems in Rstudio.

You have two options for using RStudio:\n The server version of RStudio on the web at (https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu). The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer on campus using a web browser. This server may run slow during peak days/hours. I also recommend you to download a local version of R server in your computer in case of rare outages.\n A local version of RStudio installed on your machine. This option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this course demands. Using this version you can only store your files in your local machine. Additionally, we can save our work on GitHub. We will learn how to use GitHub in the beginning of the course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source. Please make sure that you have recently updated both R and RStudio.\n  Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)  Download the latest version of R: https://cran.r-project.org/ Download the free Rstudio desktop version: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\n Use the default download and install options for each. For R, download the ‚Äúprecompiled binary‚Äù distribution rather than the source code\nUpdating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)\nIf you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.\n To check your version of R, run the command getRversion() and compare your version to the newest version posted on https://cran.r-project.org/. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.\n In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option Help \u0026gt; Check for updates. Follow directions if an update is needed.\n  ** Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update) **\nDo whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see here, but yours will be more boring because you haven‚Äôt written any code or made any figures yet!\nPut your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x \u0026lt;- 2 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 printed. If this happened, you‚Äôve succeeded in installing R and RStudio!\n  VPN If you plan to do any work off campus this term, you need to install Carleton‚Äôs VPN. This will allow you to access the maize server (if needed).\nInstalling the GlobalProtect VPN\nFollow the directions here to install VPN.\n Git and GitHub Git is version control software that you install locally on your computer. Git is already installed on the maize RStudio server.\nGithub is a cloud-based service for hosting git projects. It allows multiple users to share and contribute to projects and it is how you will be submitting homework assignments and projects for this class. More information about Git and Github can also be found in Getting setup with Git and GitHub and Git and Github.\nIf you are using a local install of R/RStudio, then you will need to install Git.\nInstalling Git\nDirections for both Windows \u0026amp; Mac here: http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html.\n If you are using maize, then there is nothing you need to install. Windows users should follow Option 1 in 6.2. Mac users can follow Option 1 in 6.3 if comfortable, otherwise follow Option 2 Linux users can follow 6.4.    Slack We will use Slack for all course communication. Sign up for our course Slack team here! You will need to create an account with a username, and log in to read and post. You can download a standalone Slack application to your Mac, Windows, Linux and/or Android/iOS device. You can control whether you receive notifications on new posts by going to Preferences, as well as decide which ‚Äòchannels‚Äô to subscribe to. A ‚Äòchannel‚Äô is a discussion thread, which is used to organize communications into topics. You can learn more about Slack features here.\nSeveral channels have been set up for specific parts of the course. Feel free to ask questions anytime. You can browse the available channels in our team by clicking on ‚ÄúChannels‚Äù on the left-hand panel.\n LaTeX You need a Latex compiler to create a pdf document from a R Markdown file. If you use the maize server, you don‚Äôt need to install anything. If you are using a local RStudio, you should install a Latex compiler. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:\n MacTeX for Mac (3.2GB)\n MiKTeX for Windows (190MB)\n Alternatively, you can install the tinytex R package by running install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\n   Acknowledgements This installation guide is based on the guide from Adam Loy and Katie St.¬†Clair.\n Resuse This work is licensed under the CC BY-NC 3.0 Creative Commons License.\n ","date":1662768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662768000,"objectID":"685d99a20c764eab219d9cd094ebadb2","permalink":"https://deepbas.netlify.app/courses/stat220/software/","publishdate":"2022-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/stat220/software/","section":"courses","summary":"R/RStudio The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an essential component of this course.

Click the Project button in the upper righthand corner of your RStudio window and select New Project‚Ä¶.        b. Select New Directory and then New Project         c. Enter content as the Directory name and use the Browse button to find your stat220 folder. Then click Create Project.      d. You should now have a new folder called content in your stat220 folder and this folder will contain an RStudio project .Rproj. Feel free to add subfolders to this content folder (e.g. slides, examples, etc).     Warning: Do not create an RStudio project in the main stat220 folder because it is not good practice to have RStudio projects in subfolders of another project (e.g. a project within a project is not recommended).\n File organization: Using your own Rstudio Create a folder called stat220 somewhere on your computer. Within this folder create an assignments subfolder. Then complete step 5 from above to create a content RStudio project folder.\n RStudio projects Once you‚Äôve created a project, your R session should be running within that project folder. You can check which project you are in by checking the project name in the upper righthand part of your RStudio window. Here we see the content project is open:\n   Running R from an RStudio project sets your working directory to the project folder:\n   This allows for easy file path access to all files related to this project.\nTo start a project, click on the .Rproj file or use the Open Project‚Ä¶ option shown in step 5 above.\n Best practices (or what not to do)  Never save files to a lab computer hard drive (e.g. desktop, downloads, etc). They will be erased when you log off. Do not use gmail as a file storage system! Avoid emailing yourself files that you created (and saved) on a lab computer. Eventually you will lose work this way. Avoid using online versions of google drive and dropbox. Similar to gmail, downloading, editing a doc, then uploading it back to drive/dropbox is another great way to lose work. Avoid this and this.

Regression models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are proven to identify patterns in time series data and this allows us to make accurate short-term predictions.\nThe model used in the following example is based on long-term short-term memory (LSTM) model that uses more than one features to make informed predictions. LSTMs are recurrent neural networks that avoid the vanishing gradient problem prevalent in feed-forward type of algorithms by imposing filtering mechanisms in the gates using a technique known as back-propagation.\nThe following set of codes loads all the required Python libraries, packages, and subroutines required for LSTM modeling. This blog post is just intended to give a high level summary of how to realize a covid case count prediction in the United States using some convenient features readily available.\n# Import various libraries and routines needed for computation import math import pandas as pd import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import keras.backend as K from math import sqrt from numpy import concatenate from matplotlib import pyplot from pandas import read_csv, DataFrame from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping from datetime import date, timedelta, datetime  # Read in the data file that has relevant features df = pd.read_csv('covid_final.csv') dataset = df.set_index(['date']) # Drop the last 10 row as they are incomplete dataset.drop(dataset.tail(10).index, inplace = True) values = dataset.values # Store the indexes (i.e., dates) date_index = dataset.index  # Clean up the dataset more for predictions and inverse transformations (Re-scaling) data_clean = dataset.copy() data_clean_ext = dataset.copy() data_clean_ext['new_cases_predictions'] = data_clean_ext['new_cases_smoothed'] data_clean.tail()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  new_cases_smoothed reproduction_rate new_tests_smoothed_per_thousand new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred total_boosters_per_hundred stringency_index   date            2022-03-08 38934.286 0.65 2.748 621 65.24 28.89 53.24   2022-03-09 36641.429 0.66 2.699 601 65.25 28.91 53.24   2022-03-10 36330.429 0.69 2.613 583 65.27 28.94 53.24   2022-03-11 36104.714 0.71 2.580 557 65.29 28.97 53.24   2022-03-12 35464.143 0.71 2.561 540 65.30 28.99 53.24     # number of rows in the data nrows = data_clean.shape[0]  The day-to-day case counts can be regarded as a time series and the data needs to be prepared before training a supervised learning model.

To do this, I suggest following these steps:\nSetup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:  library(usethis) use_git_config(user.name = \u0026quot;Jane Doe\u0026quot;, user.email = \u0026quot;jane@example.org\u0026quot;) changing the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account). Next, you should generate a PAT:  create_github_token() This function will preselect the recommended scopes. I recommend just clicking \u0026quot;Generate token\u0026quot; unless you know of a reason to tweak the scopes. Store this token somewhere, because you‚Äôll never be able to see it again once you leave that page or close the window. Treat this PAT like a password. Now that you have credentials, you need to store them. I recommend using the {gitcreds} package. Run the below chunk (after installing the package if you‚Äôre using your own laptop):  library(gitcreds) gitcreds_set() Respond to the prompt with your personal access token (PAT). You should be setup! Try to clone a GitHub project and talk to me if you still hit issues.
