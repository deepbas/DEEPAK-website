# Tests for One Categorical Variable

# What next?

.bql[
We have a test statistic.  What else do we need to perform the hypothesis test?
- A distribution of the test statistic assuming $H_0$ is true
]

<br>

.bql[How do we get this? Two options:
1. Simulation
2. Theoretical Distribution
]

---

# Simulation

.bqt.font90[
1. Take 3 scraps of paper and label them Rock, Paper, Scissors. Fold or crumple them so they are indistinguishable. Choose one at random and record the result.

2. Repeat a number of times to match the original sample size and get a table of observed counts. 

3. Calculate the $\chi^{2}$-statistic.

4. Repeat this many times to get a randomization distribution of many $\chi^{2}$-statistics.

5. How extreme is the actual test statistic in this randomization distribution?

# Chi-Square Distribution

.bql[
If each of the expected counts are at least 5, AND if the null hypothesis is true, then the $\chi^2$ statistic follows a $\chi^2$ distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to

$$df = \text{number of categories} -1$$

# Goodness of Fit

.bq[
- A $\chi^2$ test for goodness of fit test determines whether the distribution of a categorical variable is the same as some null hypothesized distribution

- The null hypothesized proportions for each category do not have to be the same
]

---

# Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit

.bql.font90[
- State null hypothesized proportions for each category, pi.  Alternative is that at least one of the proportions is different than specified in the null.

- Calculate the expected counts for each cell as $n\cdot p_i$.  Make sure they are all greater than 5 to proceed.

- Calculate the $\chi^2$ statistic: $\chi^2 = \sum{\frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected}}$

- Compute the p-value as the area in the tail above the $\chi^2$ statistic, for a $\chi^2$ distribution with   $df = (\text{number of categories - 1})$.

- Interpret the p-value in context.

# Mendel’s Pea Experiment

.bq[
Between 1856 and 1863 Gregor Mendel cultivated and tested roughly 29,000 pea plants. This study showed that one in four pea plants was pure-bred recessive, two out of four were hybrid and one out of four were pure-bred dominant. 

Mendel's work was rejected at first and was not widely accepted until after he died. He is now known as the “father of modern genetics
