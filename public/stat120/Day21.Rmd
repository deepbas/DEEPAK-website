# Multiple Categories

.blockquote[
So far, we’ve learned how to do inference for a difference in means IF the categorical variable has only two categories (i.e. compare two groups)

In this section, we’ll learn how to do hypothesis tests for a difference in means across multiple categories (i.e. compare more than two groups)

# Hypotheses

.blockquote[To test for a difference in true/population means across k groups:

\begin{align*}
H_{0}:& \quad \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\ldots=\mu_{k}\\

# Frisbee Example 

.out-t[Does Frisbee grip affect the distance of a throw?]

.blockquote.font80[
- A student performed the following experiment: 3 grips, 8 throws using each grip

    1. Normal grip
    2. One finger out grip
    3. Frisbee inverted grip
]

.blockquote.font80[
- A grip type is randomly assigned to each of the 24 throws she plans on making

  - Response: measured in paces how far her throw went

# Why Analyze Variability to Test for a Difference in Means?

.pull-left-40[

.blockquote[
Conclusion: An assessment of the difference in means between several groups depends on two kinds of variability:
1. How different the means are from each other
2. The amount of variability in the samples.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) compares the variability between groups to the variability within groups

# F-Statistic

.blockquote[
The F-statistic is a ratio:
$$F=\frac{M S G}{M S E}=\frac{\text { average between group variability }}{\text { average within group variability }}$$

If there really is a difference between the groups $(H_A \text{ true})$, we would expect the F-statistic to be

a) Large positive

b) Large negative

C) Close to 0

The correct answer is a. If there is a difference, we expect the between group variability to be higher than within group variability. .red[RIGHT TAIL test!]

# F-distribution

---

# F-Distribution

.blockquote[
We can use the F-distribution to generate a p-value if:

  1. Sample sizes in each group are large (each $n_{i} \geq 30$ ) OR the data within each group are relatively normally distributed
  2. Variability is similar in all groups
]
<br>
.blockquote[

- The F-distribution has two degrees of freedom, one for the numerator of the ratio $(\boldsymbol{k}-\mathbf{1})$ and one for the denominator $(n-k)$
- For F-statistics, the p-value (the area as extreme or more extreme) is always the right tail

.pull-right-40[
.blockquote[
- An F-statistic as large as 2.045 would occur by chance about 16% of the time if the means were all equal.
- Our results are inconclusive and do not support the claim that grips affects average distance.

# Check Assumptions: Equal Variance

.blockquote[
The F-distribution assumes equal within group variability for each group

* This is also an assumption when using the .bold[randomization distribution].

- As a rough .bold[rule of thumb], this assumption is violated if the largest group standard deviation is more than double the smallest group standard deviation

# Frisbee Example: Inference

One-way ANOVA hypotheses:

.blockquote-list.font90[
.bold[Question:] Is this evidence that grip affects mean distance thrown? 
\begin{align*}
H_{0}:& \quad \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}\\
H_{a}:& \quad \text{At least one } \mu_{1}, \mu_{2}, \mu_{3} \text{ is not the same}
\end{align*}
$\mu_{\mathrm{i}}$ is the true mean distance thrown using grip $i$.
]

$$F=2.05(\mathrm{df}=2,21), \text { P-value }=0.1543$$


.blockquote.font90[
.bold[Conclusion:] Do not reject the Null hypothesis. The difference in observed means is not statistically significant.

About 15% of the time we would see the grip differences like those observed, or even bigger, when there is actually no difference between the true mean distances thrown with different grips.
