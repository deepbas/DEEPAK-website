# The SE for means

.blockquote.font80[
- The standard error for $\bar{x}$ is
$$S E_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
where $\sigma$ is the population SD of your response

- The standard error for $\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}$ is
$$S E_{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}$$

# Central Limit Theorem for means: One sample

The sampling distribution for a sample mean is approximately $N\left(\mu, S E_{\bar{x}}\right)$]

<br>

.blockquote[
When is this approximately "good"?

- if $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ then $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \sigma / \sqrt{n})$

- if $X \nsim N(\mu, \sigma)$ then $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \sigma / \sqrt{n})$ if $n \geqslant 30$

# Problem!

.blockquote.font90[
- The estimated SE varies from sample to sample, along with $\bar{x}$ ! 

- In $z$, only $\bar{x}$ varies from sample to sample
$$z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1)$$

- In $t$, both $\bar{x}$ and $s$ vary from sample to sample
$$t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim ? ? ?$$

When is this approximately "good"?

# Florida lakes

- 53 lakes were sampled, pH recorded

  - Is average pH in Florida lakes different from 7 (neutral)?

- Let $\mu$ be the mean pH for all Florida lakes

- Can we use a t-test?

  - $n=53$ is a decent sample size
  - check sample distribution of pHs

- The t-test stat is
$$t = \dfrac{6.591 - 7}{1.288/\sqrt{53}} \approx -2.31$$

- .bold[Interpret:] The p-value is 0.025. If the mean pH of all lakes is 7, then we would see a sample mean that is at least 2.31 SEs away from 7 about 2.5% of the time in samples of 53 lakes.

How different is the population mean from 7?

- 95% CI for $\mu$:


$$6.591 \pm 2.0066 \dfrac{1.288}{\sqrt{53}} = 6.591 \pm 0.355 = 6.236, 6.946$$

# Academic Performance Index (API) 

.blockquote-list[
Academic Performance Index (API) is a number reflecting a schoolâ€™s performance on a statewide standardized test
  - simple random sample of $n=200$ schools
  - variable `growth` measures the growth in API from 1999 to 2000 (API 2000 - API 1999).

# Hypothesis Test

.blockquote.font80[
Can we use t-inference methods to compare mean growths?
  - both samples sizes (98 and 102) can be deemed large 
  - No severe skewness (but two extreme outliers)

.blockquote.font80[
- Estimated Standard Error 
$$SD_{\bar{x}_h - \bar{x}_l} = \sqrt{\dfrac{28.75380^2}{102} + \dfrac{29.95048^2}{98}} = 4.1544$$

.blockquote.font90[
.bold[Removing Outliers:]
- the difference in means shifted further away from 0
- CI shifted further from a difference of 0
- decrease the SE of our sample difference
]

.blockquote.font90[
.bold[Interpretation:] We are 95% confident that the mean API growth between 1999 and 2000 for all low wealth
schools is anywhere from 8.96 points to 23.57 points higher than the mean API growth for all high wealth
schools in California.

# Paired Data

.blockquote-list.font90[
- Data are paired if the data being compared consists of paired data values

- Common paired data examples:
  - Two measurements on each case
  - natural pairs (twins, spouses, etc)
]
--

.blockquote.font90[
- Use paired data to reduce natural variation in the response when comparing the two groups/treatments
  - comparing group 1 and 2 responses among similar individuals 
  - reduces the effects of confounding variables
  - reduces the SE for the mean difference!
]

class: middle

# Analyzing paired data

.blockquote.font80[
- Look at the difference between responses for each unit (pair)
$$d_{i} = x_{1,i} - x_{2,i}$$

- Analyze the .bold[mean of these differences] rather than the average difference between two groups
$$\textrm{sample mean difference: } \bar{d}$$
$$\textrm{sample SD of difference: } s_d$$
$$\textrm{population mean difference: } \mu_d$$

- Use .bold[one sample] inference methods for these differences
]

---

# Tuition example

.blockquote.font90[
- How much higher is non-resident tuition, on average, compared to resident tuition?

- Use the `Tuition2006.csv` lab manual data
  - the variable `Diff` computues the difference `Res` - `NonRes`
]
    
```{r, collapse=TRUE, highlight.output = 6}
tuition <- read.csv("http://math.carleton.edu/Stats215/RLabManual/Tuition2006.csv")
str(tuition)
```

## Tuition example

.blockquote.font80[
- Smaller sample size (n=19) and slightly left-skewed distribution or roughly symmetric with one low case!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tuition, aes(x = Diff)) +
