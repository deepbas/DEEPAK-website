# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

&lt;!-- 

- Each line of code tells the browser how to show every element in your display by assigning tags to each component within the body tag. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Most of the data on the web is still largely available as HTML --&gt;

&gt; HTML page consists of series of elements which browsers use to interpret how to display the content

&lt;img src="images/html.png"  width="600" height="400" class="center"&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;!--
- Contains all the metadata inside the head tag

- Only need to understand the document’s body tag as there’s where the content we want to scrape resides.

--&gt;

# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

&gt; While it is structured (hierarchical/tree based) it often is not available in a form useful for analysis (flat / tidy).

&lt;br&gt;

.font120[
```html
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;p align="center"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;

## HTML tags

&gt; HTML uses `tags` to describe different aspects of document content

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

.font120[
Tag         |  Example
------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
heading     | `&lt;h1&gt;My Title&lt;/h1&gt;`
paragraph   | `&lt;p&gt;A paragraph of content...&lt;/p&gt;`
table       | `&lt;table&gt; ... &lt;/table&gt;`
anchor (with attribute)     | `&lt;a href="http://www.ratebeer.com"&gt;click here for link&lt;/a&gt;`
