Deepak Bastola here, someone who is deeply passionate about the interplay between statistics and the mysteries of the cosmos. My educational background includes a Ph.D. in Applied Statistics and an M.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics, both of which have equipped me to delve deeper into my quest for understanding. Throughout this academic path, I've been fortunate to employ statistical approaches in an effort to better understand astronomical events and to create meaningful data interpretations. My primary research areas are Bayesian statistics, time series methodology, statistical computation, and machine learning.
