### Before next class

Students are expected to open a GitHub account, verify it, and connect RStudio with that account using personal access token (PAT) credential methods. Once this step is finished, students should clone a git repository on their local machines using git version control methods ([tutorial](https://deepbas.io/courses/stat220/github-in-stat-220/#creating-an-individual-assignment-repo-and-project)), modify the files, save, commit, and push the changes to the remote repository associated with their GitHub username. Here is one useful video about Git and Github, [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY).

Also, please read through all the course set-up modules and test your R skills by doing the test-assignment named hw0-username accessible here, [Stat 220 Organization GitHub page](https://github.com/DataScienceFall22/). It will be useful to go over [how to connect Github and Rstudio](https://deepbas.io/courses/stat220/github-in-stat-220/#individual-assignments) again. If you can successfully push your modifications, then you should be set up for this course, technically. Please try to achieve this by Friday. We will also do a live demo in class on Wednesday.

_Optional_ (if you need more review):

If it has been a LONG time since you took STAT 120 or used R, then this crash course is helpful: [programming basics primer from RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2). These resources are also useful if you feel like you are starting from scratch: [R and RStudio Basics](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/3-rstudiobasics.html) and [R Markdown](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/4-rmarkdown.html)
