### Before next class

Students are expected to open a GitHub account, verify it, and connect RStudio with that account using personal access token (PAT) credential methods. Once this step is finished, students should clone a git repository on their local machines using git version control methods ([tutorial](https://deepbas.io/courses/stat220/github-in-stat-220/#creating-an-individual-assignment-repo-and-project)), modify the files, save, commit, and push the changes to the remote repository associated with their GitHub username. Here is one useful video about Git and Github, [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY).
