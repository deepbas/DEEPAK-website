### Before next class

Students are expected to open a GitHub account, verify it, and connect RStudio with that account using personal access token (PAT) credential methods. Once this step is finished, students should clone a git repository on their local machines using git version control methods ([tutorial](https://deepbas.io/courses/stat220/github-in-stat-220/#creating-an-individual-assignment-repo-and-project)), modify the files, save, commit, and push the changes to the remote repository associated with their GitHub username. Here is one useful video about Git and Github, [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY).

Also, please read through all the course set-up modules and test your R skills by doing the test-assignment named hw0-username accessible here shortly, [Stat 220 Organization GitHub page](https://github.com/DataScienceFall22/).If you can successfully push your modifications, then you should be set up for this course, technically. Please try to achieve this by Friday. We will also do a live demo in class on Wednesday.
