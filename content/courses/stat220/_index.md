## Course overview 

Welcome to introduction to data science! This course will cover the computational side of data analysis, including data acquisition, management, and visualization tools. The course introduces principles of data-scientific, reproducible research and dynamic programming using the R/RStudio ecosystem. 

If you took Stat 120, 230, or 250 at Carleton, then you are in good shape. It is essential to recap your basic R and R-markdown skills by the first week of the class. Specifically, I expect that everyone can load a data set into R, calculate basic summary statistics, and create basic exploratory data analysis. I will expose you to Git and GitHub version control in the first week of the class and prior exposure to these is not required.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop research questions that can be answered by data. Import/scrape data into R and reshape it to the form necessary for analysis.
- Manipulate common types of data, including numeric, categorical (factors), text, date-times, geo-location variables in order to provide insight into your data and facilitate analysis.
- Explore data using both graphical and numeric methods to provide insight and uncover relationships/patterns.
- Utilize fundamental programming concepts such as iteration, conditional execution, and functions to streamline your code.
- Build, tune, use, and evaluate basic statistical learning models to uncover clusters and classify observations.
- Draw informed conclusions from your data and communicate your findings using both written and interactive platforms.
