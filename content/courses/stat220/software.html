<h2>R/RStudio</h2>
<p>The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an
essential component of this course. You have two options for using
RStudio:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>server version</strong> of RStudio on the web at
(<a href="https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu" class="uri">https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu</a>). The advantage of using the
server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud,
where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you
can access your work from any computer on campus using a web
browser. This server may run slow during peak days/hours. I also recommend
you to download a local version of R server in your computer in case of rare outages.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>local version</strong> of RStudio installed on your machine. This
option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this
course demands. Using this version you can only store your files in your local machine. Additionally, we can save our work on GitHub. We will learn how to use GitHub in the beginning of the course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source. Please make sure that you have recently updated both R and RStudio.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Download the latest version of R: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>
Download the free Rstudio desktop version: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the default download and install options for each. For R, download the “precompiled binary” distribution rather than the source code</p>
<p><strong>Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize server)</strong></p>
<p>If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have the most recent versions of each program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To check your version of R, run the command <code>getRversion()</code> and compare your version to the newest version posted on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>. If you need an update, then install the newer version using the installation directions above.</p></li>
<li><p>In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option <code>Help &gt; Check for updates</code>. Follow directions if an update is needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>** Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update) **</p>
<p>Do whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch
RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png">here</a>,
but yours will be more boring because you haven’t written any code
or made any figures yet!</p>
<p>Put your cursor in the pane labeled <em>Console</em>, which is where you
interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
like <code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code> (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the
<code>x</code> object by typing <code>x</code> followed by enter or return. You should see
the value <code>8</code> printed. If this happened, you’ve succeeded in
installing R and RStudio!</p>

<div id="vpn" class="section level2">
<h2>VPN</h2>
<p>If you plan to do any work off campus this term, you need to install Carleton’s VPN. This will allow you to access the <strong>maize</strong> server (if needed).</p>
<p><strong>Installing the GlobalProtect VPN</strong></p>
<p>Follow the directions <a href="https://wiki.carleton.edu/display/itskb/GlobalProtect+VPN">here</a> to install VPN.</p>

<div id="git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
<p><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-git">Git</a> is version
control software that you install locally on your computer. Git is
already installed on the maize RStudio server.</p>
<p><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-github">Github</a> is a
cloud-based service for hosting git projects. It allows multiple users
to share and contribute to projects and it is how you will be submitting
homework assignments and projects for this class. More information about Git and
Github can also be found in <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/">Getting setup with Git and
GitHub</a> and <a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com/rpkg/#gitgithub">Git and Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a local install of R/RStudio, then you will need to
install Git.</p>
<p><strong>Installing Git</strong></p>
<p>Directions for both Windows &amp; Mac here:
<a href="http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html" class="uri">http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you are using <strong>maize</strong>, then there is nothing you need to install.</li>
<li>Windows users should follow Option 1 in 6.2.</li>
<li>Mac users can follow Option 1 in 6.3 if comfortable, otherwise follow Option 2</li>
<li>Linux users can follow 6.4.</li>

<div id="slack" class="section level2">
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>We will use Slack for all course communication. <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/datasciencefall22/shared_invite/zt-1fiwi30yr-MysFDWn0uuQZbS39X~5KTw">Sign up for our course
Slack team
here</a>!
You will need to create an account with a username, and log in to read
and post. You can download a
standalone Slack application to your
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/osx">Mac</a>,
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/windows">Windows</a>,
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/linux">Linux</a> and/or
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/android">Android</a>/<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/ios">iOS</a>
device. You can control whether you receive notifications on new posts
by going to Preferences, as well as decide which ‘channels’ to subscribe
to. A ‘channel’ is a discussion thread, which is used to organize
communications into topics. You can learn more about Slack features
<a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users">here</a>.</p>
<p>Several channels have been set up for specific parts of the course. Feel
free to ask questions anytime. You can browse the available channels in
our team by clicking on “Channels” on the left-hand panel.</p>

<div id="latex" class="section level2">
<h2>LaTeX</h2>
<p>You need a Latex compiler to create a pdf document from a R Markdown file. If you use the maize server, you don’t need to install anything. If you are using a local RStudio, you should install a Latex compiler. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> for Mac (3.2GB)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a> for Windows (190MB)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can install the <code>tinytex</code> R package by running
<code>install.packages("tinytex")</code> in the console.</p></li>
</ul>
