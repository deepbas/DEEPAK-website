<h2>R/RStudio</h2>
<p>The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an
essential component of this course. You have two options for using
RStudio:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>server version</strong> of RStudio on the web at
(<a href="https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu" class="uri">https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu</a>). The advantage of using the
server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud,
where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you
can access your work from any computer on campus using a web
browser. The downside is that you have to share limited
computational resources with each other! This limitation is
especially pronounced this term when classes are being taught
remotely. We are unsure what type of load will be placed on maize,
so if you can download a local version of R and RStudio, I recommend
you do so. Use your Carleton credentials to access your account and
you need to be running the Carleton VPN (below) to access this
server.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>local version</strong> of RStudio installed on your machine. This
option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this
course demands. The downside to this approach is that your work is
only stored locally, but I get around this problem by keeping all of
my work on GitHub. You will learn how to use GitHub throughout the
course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source.</p>
<p><strong>Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize
server)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Download the latest version of R: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Download the free Rstudio desktop version:
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Use the default download and install options for each. For R,
download the “precompiled binary” distribution rather than the
source code</p>
<p><strong>Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize
server)</strong></p>
<p>If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still
installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have
the most recent versions of each program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To check your version of R, run the command <code>getRversion()</code> and
compare your version to the newest version posted on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>. If you need an update, then
install the newer version using the installation directions
above.</p></li>
<li><p>In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option
<code>Help &gt; Check for updates</code>. Follow directions if an update is
needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="did-it-work-a-sanity-check-after-your-installupdate">Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update)</h3>
<p>Do whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch
RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png">here</a>,
but yours will be more boring because you haven’t written any code
or made any figures yet!</p>
<p>Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you
interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
like <code>x &lt;- 2 * 4</code> (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the
<code>x</code> object by typing <code>x</code> followed by enter or return. You should see
the value 8 printed. If this happened, you’ve succeeded in
installing R and RStudio!</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
<p><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-git">Git</a> is version
control software that you install locally on your computer. Git is
already installed on the maize RStudio server.</p>
<p><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-github">Github</a> is a
cloud-based service for hosting git projects. It allows multiple users
to share and contribute to projects and it is how you will be submitting
homework assignments and projects for this class. More information about Git and
Github can also be found in <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/">Getting setup with Git and
GitHub</a> and <a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com/rpkg/#gitgithub">Git and Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a local install of R/RStudio, then you will need to
install Git.</p>
<p><strong>Installing Git</strong></p>
<p>Directions for both Windows &amp; Mac here:
<a href="http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html" class="uri">http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are using <strong>maize</strong>, then there is nothing you need to
install.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows users should follow Option 1 in 6.2.</p></li>
<li><p>Mac users can follow Option 1 in 6.3 if comfortable, otherwise
follow Option 2</p></li>
<li><p>Linux users can follow 6.4.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="slack" class="section level2">
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>We will use Slack for all course communication. <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/stat220datasc-wmz5924/shared_invite/zt-110xuf0zq-0Ap9EaQAp46YiilE4Jvc~A">Sign up for our course
Slack team
here</a>!
You will need to create an account with a username, and log in to read
and post. You can download a
standalone Slack application to your
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/osx">Mac</a>,
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/windows">Windows</a>,
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/linux">Linux</a> and/or
<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/android">Android</a>/<a href="https://slack.com/downloads/ios">iOS</a>
device. You can control whether you receive notifications on new posts
by going to Preferences, as well as decide which ‘channels’ to subscribe
to. A ‘channel’ is a discussion thread, which is used to organize
communications into topics. You can learn more about Slack features
<a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users">here</a>.</p>
<p>Several channels have been set up for specific parts of the course. Feel
free to ask questions anytime. You can browse the available channels in
our team by clicking on “Channels” on the left-hand panel.</p>
<p>There is also an #anonymous channel that you can use if you’d like to
ask a question or provide a comment anonymously. To have a post appear
anonymously in this channel, compose a direct message to yourself (by
clicking on your username in the ‘Direct Messages’ menu on the left
panel) that begins with /anon #anonymous your question. Then the text
your question will be sent to the #anonymous channel by the anonymous
bot. Zoom For synchronous class meeting and office hours we will use the
Zoom video conferencing software. I recommend downloading the Zoom app
for your operating system.</p>

<div id="latex" class="section level2">
<h2>LaTeX</h2>
<p>If you want to render R Markdown documents to PDFs, then you need to
install LaTeX. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> for Mac (3.2GB)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a> for Windows (190MB)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can install the <code>tinytex</code> R package by running
<code>install.packages("tinytex")</code> in the console.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using maize, then there is nothing you need to install.</p>
