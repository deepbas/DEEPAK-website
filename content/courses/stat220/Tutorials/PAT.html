<p>After you have signed up for a GitHub account and gone through all of the account verification steps, you will need to generate a personal access token (PAT) and let R know what that is. To do this, I suggest following these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Setup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, user.email = &quot;jane@example.org&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>changing the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account).</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next, you should generate a PAT:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>create_github_token()</code></pre>
<pre><code>This function will preselect the recommended scopes. I recommend just clicking &quot;Generate token&quot; unless you know of a reason to tweak the scopes. Store this token somewhere, because you’ll never be able to see it again once you leave that page or close the window. Treat this PAT like a password.</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now that you have credentials, you need to store them. I recommend using the <code>{gitcreds}</code> package. Run the below chunk (after installing the package if you’re using your own laptop):</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()</code></pre>
<pre><code>Respond to the prompt with your personal access token (PAT).</code></pre>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You should be setup! Try to clone a GitHub project and talk to me if you still hit issues.</li>
</ol>
